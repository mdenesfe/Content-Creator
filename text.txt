“One day, all your hard work will pay off.”
“The earlier you start working on something, the earlier you will see results.”
“Life is short. Live it. Fear is natural. Face it. Memory is powerful. Use it.”
“Do what is right, not what is easy.”
“We generate fears while we do nothing. We overcome these fears by taking action.”
“If we wait until we’re ready, we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives.”
