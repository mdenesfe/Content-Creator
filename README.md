My post about [ft_printf](https://medium.com/@mdenesfe/creating-images-from-text-with-python-and-pil-6a8ae432059d)

This code snippet reads the texts from 'text.txt' file and creates an image for each text. Images are saved in 'images' folder and each image is named 'x_new_post.jpg' (x is a number according to the order of the images).

## Getting Started

1. First, 'text.txt' file is read and texts are read.
2. An image is created for each text.
3. Images are saved in 'images' folder.
4. Each image is named 'x_new_post.jpg' (x is a number according to the order of the images).

## Requirements

This code snippet requires the 'text.txt' file and 'images' folder to be present. It uses python 3.x and PIL (Python Imaging Library) library.

```bash
  pip install pillow
```
```bash
  pip install PIL
```

## Running

To run this code snippet, you only need to run `python main.py` command in your console or terminal.
